## How to use Monkey Falsify for yourself
<details>
<summary>Tutoria</summary>
  1. Using Monkey Falsify is easy. First, you want to have a proxy link or your own proxy link. Check out Doge Unblocker, or whatever proxy, and deploy it via any deployment service (railway is easy & free!)  
  2. I recommend you use your own proxy link, as it's fresh and likely to not be blocked on an iframe.  
  3. Next, you're going to want to change [[ADD LATER]]  
  4. Now, launch your site. You can use free services like InfinityFree, or paid services. You can also fork this repository if you wish for the proxy you use to be public  
  5. You'll then head over to your page. You might be shocked by a GoGuardian 'blocked' page, but this is fake.  
  6. Simply type anywhere on screen "letmein", and the site changes to the real page  
  7. Happy Unblocking!
